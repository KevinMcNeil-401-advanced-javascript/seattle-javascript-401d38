# JavaScript 401 Warm-Up - UI Cards

## Setup

- Create a new Code Sand box workspace and start a new React Project.

## Warm-Up Exercise

Create a `Card` component using either class or functional component design patterns.  The Card should take 3 different props and wrap around a text element as it `children`. The props that the component needs are:

- `title` {string} a title to display at the top of the card
- `image` {string} a path to an image or an imported image that will be displayed below the title
- `subtitle` {string} some short text to display the image

 The component should take in the `title`, `image`, and `subtitle` properties and display them all nicely within the card component. It's `children` should be displayed as a block of text below the `image` prop.

- Feel free to add any special features that you want to the `Card`, as long as it still uses all the props mentioned above.
- Use any styling methodology and aesthetics that you want.
- If time allows, write tests that prove your component renders what it should!
