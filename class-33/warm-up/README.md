# Warm Up - Camel Case

A string is considered camel cased when they contain only text characters with no spaces between words and the first letter of every word is upper cased and every other character is lower cased.  The letter in the first word however, is lower cased.  

For example: the string 'oneTwoThree' contains 3 words in camel case.

## Problem Domain

- Write tests for a function called `camelCase` that takes in a string and returns the number of words that are camel cased in that string.
  - Try to come up with at least 3 tests to prove that a solution was reached.
  - If you have any questions about output, write them down.
- Once you finish your tests create an algorithm that could pass those tests.
