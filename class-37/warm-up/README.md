# Warm Up - Fibonacci

Another common javascript whiteboarding challenge involves the Fibonacci sequence.  The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, where each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the 2 numbers before it.  The first 2 numbers in the the sequence are 0 followed by 1, the subsequent number would be 1 ( 0 plus 1 ) followed by 2 ( 1 plus 1 ) and so on for infinity.  If we were looking for the 3rd value of the Fibonacci sequence we would return 2.

fibonacci values:    `[ 0, 1, 1, 2 ]`
fibonacci positions: `  0  1  2  3  `

- Work on an algorithm that can take in an integer `n` representing a fibonacci value position and return that value from the fibonacci sequence.
- After you come up with the steps for your algorithm.  Walk through the alogrithm with your partner, from start to finish, using a visual drawing to prove that your algorithm works.

```javascript

// tests

fibonacci(3)  // => 2
fibonacci(5)  // => 5
fibonacci(10) // => 55

```
