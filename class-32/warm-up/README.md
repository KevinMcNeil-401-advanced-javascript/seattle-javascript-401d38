# Warm Up - Are 2 Strings Anagrams

- Two words are anagrams when the set of characters in the first word can be used to spell the second word.
  - Example: 'pots' and 'stop' are anagrams.
- Work in pairs to come up with a drawing or visualization for the problem domain and set of enumerated steps that we can use to come up an algorithm for a function.

```javascript

anagram('dormitory', 'dirty room'); // returns true

anagram('school master', 'the classroom'); // returns true

anagram('not', 'right') // returns false

```
